# Loan Approval Prediction

[Final Preview](https://loan-approval-prediction-xv8q.onrender.com)

**Dataset Overview**

[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anishdevedward/loan-approval-dataset)

This dataset simulates loan applications and their approval outcomes for 2,000 individuals. It includes a range of demographic, financial, and employment-related attributes such as age, income, credit score, loan amount, employment status, and existing debts.
The dataset aims to model credit risk and loan approval prediction, providing an excellent opportunity to practice binary classification, data preprocessing, and feature engineering in the financial domain.


‚òÄÔ∏è**Objective:**

Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant attributes.

‚úÖ**Result**
Achieved a model with following metrics:
```
    Train accuracy:  0.94375
    Test accuracy:  0.92
    ROC AUC: 0.9236987232756666
    Precision: 0.8719211822660099
    Recall: 0.9672131147540983
    F1-score: 0.917098445595855
```
üñ•Ô∏è**Applications:**

* Credit risk modeling

* Loan approval prediction

* Customer profiling

* Model interpretability and fairness analysis
