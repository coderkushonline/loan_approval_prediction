# Loan Approval Prediction

**Dataset Overview**

[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anishdevedward/loan-approval-dataset)

This dataset simulates loan applications and their approval outcomes for 2,000 individuals. It includes a range of demographic, financial, and employment-related attributes such as age, income, credit score, loan amount, employment status, and existing debts.
The dataset aims to model credit risk and loan approval prediction, providing an excellent opportunity to practice binary classification, data preprocessing, and feature engineering in the financial domain.


‚òÄÔ∏è**Objective:**

Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant attributes.

üñ•Ô∏è**Applications:**

* Credit risk modeling

* Loan approval prediction

* Customer profiling

* Model interpretability and fairness analysis

### üöÄProject Workflow
1. Import Libraries & Load Dataset
    
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Feature Engineering

3. Data Preprocessing

4. Model Building

5. Hyperparameter Tuning (if necessary)

6. Model Evaluation

7. Model Export

8. UI Design

9. Deployment
